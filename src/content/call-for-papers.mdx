# Call for Papers

We invite submissions to the First Workshop on AI Assisting Scientific Research (SCI-HAI). This workshop aims to bring together researchers from different communities, including ML, NLP, Human-Computer Interaction, and various scientific disciplines such as biology and chemistry, to work together on the design, development, and evaluation of various forms of scientific LLMs and systems.

Significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in using these frontier AI models to assist researchers in various scientific tasks, such as idea generation, experiment execution, automated ML engineering, searching and synthesizing literature reviews, literature-based question-answering, performing data analysis, data-driven discovery, or even the entire end-to-end research pipeline including paper generation.

Through our interdisciplinary program, we aim to foster new connections for this emerging community.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions on topics including but not limited to:

### Methods and Modeling Techniques
- Training specialized LLMs for various scientific domains or applications
- Developing LLM agents to accelerate complex scientific workflows
- New human-AI collaboration paradigms to empower human scientists
- Novel interfaces for human-AI collaboration in scientific contexts

### Datasets, Benchmarks, and Evaluations
- Careful evaluation and analysis of AI-generated research artifacts
- New automatic benchmarks and evaluators for measuring domain knowledge
- Capabilities assessment of scientific LLMs
- User studies of scientists interacting with AI systems

### Applications and Position Papers
- Ethical considerations and societal impact of deploying scientific AI systems
- Potential safety risks and mitigation for autonomous research agents
- Case studies of human-AI collaboration in specific scientific domains
- Position papers on the future of AI in scientific discovery
